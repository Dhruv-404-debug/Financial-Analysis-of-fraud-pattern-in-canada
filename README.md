# Fraud Financial Analysis: Canada (2021-2023)

Overview
This project analyzes fraud trends in Canada from 2021 to 2023 to identify which types of fraud lead to the most significant financial losses. It explores the distribution of financial losses across different demographic groups (gender, age range) and geographic regions (provinces), while examining temporal variations. The goal is to uncover patterns and inform strategies for fraud prevention and awareness.

Key Objectives
Identify which gender groups are most frequently targeted and suffer the greatest financial losses.
Examine the provinces most impacted by fraud and analyze average individual losses.
Determine the age ranges most vulnerable to fraud and financial losses.
Explore trends over time to understand evolving fraud dynamics.
Data Cleaning and Preparation
To ensure accuracy and reliability, the dataset underwent several cleaning steps:

Removal of Missing/Null Values: Any records with null or missing data were excluded to maintain dataset integrity.
Outlier Removal:
Age ranges such as deceased and business were removed as they were deemed irrelevant.
Ages in the range of 1-9 were excluded, assuming infants and young children cannot realistically be scammed.
Categorical Refinements:
Gender categories like not available, prefer not to say, and unknown were retained but treated separately to account for their significance in the dataset.
No major transformations or reformatting were required for the dataset.

Analysis Highlights
1. Financial Analysis by Gender
Objective: Determine which gender faced the highest fraud targeting and financial loss.
Insights:
Older men experienced the greatest financial losses.
A significant portion of the data had missing or ambiguous gender information (unknown, not available), highlighting potential gaps in reporting.
2. Financial Analysis by Province
Objective: Identify the most affected provinces and quantify average individual losses.
Insights:
British Columbia saw the highest financial losses, with individuals losing an average of $8,700.
Quebec had relatively lower loss rates, possibly due to stricter anti-fraud measures.
3. Financial Analysis by Age Range
Objective: Discover which age ranges are most vulnerable to fraud.
Insights:
Older adults (ages 50-89) were the most affected.
Younger age groups experienced significantly fewer financial losses.
Conclusion
Most Impacted Groups:

Gender: Men incurred the highest financial losses.
Age: Older adults (50-89 years) were particularly vulnerable.
Province: British Columbia was the most affected province.
Actionable Insights:

Awareness campaigns and educational programs should target older demographics to prevent fraud.
Stricter anti-fraud measures could help mitigate losses, as evidenced by Quebecâ€™s lower loss rates.
Data Gaps:
Significant missing or ambiguous gender data (unknown, not available) suggests room for improvement in data collection and reporting.
